	range, and is entirely software-controlled by the platform. Evaluation
	of the proposed design was conducted using the Universal Software
	Radio Peripheral (USRP) software defined radio platform and controlled
	via GNU Radio software. A prototype of the design was successfully
	demonstrated over a wide range of frequencies. Finally, several remaining
	design challenges are identified that would further enhance transmission

	components. This allows the SDR handset to be specifically tailored
	to the applications expected to run on the handset resulting in great
	flexibility. The downloadable software components can be signal processing
	components, protocol components or application components. The SDR
	forum is evolving a download protocol in liaison with the MExE (mobile
	execution environment) activities of the ETSI forum. Software download
	overheads are an important issue in realizing viable software radios.
	Download requests can be initiated by the user terminal, which is
	termed as a PULL operation or the base station (or the download server)
	can initiate the download process which is termed as a PUSH operation.
	We assert that PUSH is an important mode of software download and
